			<h3>Necessary Step After Installation</h3>
		</header>
		<p>After successfully installing the Who Hit The Page - Hit Counter wordpress plugin, it should be ready for use. However, you still need to to do one little thing;.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>To put the plugin into real use, copy and paste or type <code>[whohit]Page name / identifier[/whohit]</code>
			anywhere in your contact page or any other page where you want the form displayed. 
			Save your page and preview it in your browser to see how the form looks on your website's theme
				<ul>
					<li>
					Place the following shortcode snippet in any page or post you wish visitors counted on. <code>[whohit]-Page name or identifier-[/whohit]</code> 
- please remember to replace the `<code>-Page name or identifier-</code>` with the name of the page you placed the shortcode on, 
if you like you can put in anything you want to use as an identifier for the page.
					</li>
					<li>
					For example: On our <a href="http://3pxwebstudios.co.nf/about-us">about us page</a> we placed <code>[whohit]About Us[/whohit]</code>
and on our <a href="http://3pxwebstudios.co.nf/web-hosting">web hosting</a> page we placed <code>[whohit]Web Hosting[/whohit]</code>. 
					</li>
					<li>
					Please note that what you put between [whohit] and [/whohit] doesn\'t need to be the same as the page name - that means 
for our <a href="http://3pxwebstudios.co.nf/web-design-and-development">website design and development page</a> we can use
 <code>[whohit]Development[whohit]</code> instead of the whole <code>[whohit]website design and development page[whohit]</code> string, 
 its completely up to you what you put as long as you will be able to see it on your admin what page has how many visits.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
